**Predictive Models for Efficient Water Management System in Calgary**

**Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of machine learning models for predicting water demand in Calgary.
The project integrates real-time data with historical datasets to develop and evaluate predictive models.
The objective is to optimize water distribution and contribute to sustainable water management practices.

**Features**

-Data preprocessing and cleaning for multiple datasets (water quality, historical flow, weather, and real-time data).

-Feature engineering to enhance predictive capability.

--Visualizations for trends, feature importance, and prediction accuracy.

-Implementation and comparison of Linear Regression and Random Forest models using both real time data and without it.

-Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).

-Model Comparison based on the Performance Metric.

-Visualization of Results.
